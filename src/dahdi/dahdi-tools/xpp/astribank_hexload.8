.B astribank_tool -D \fIdevice-path\fR <\fB-F|-p\fR> [\fIoptions\fR] \fIhexfile\fR

.B astribank_tool [-h]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B astribank_hexload
is a second-stage firmware loader for Xorcom Astribanks. Note that some 
older models use fpga_load(8) instead.

It is used to load a file in the Intel HEX format into a Xorcom
Astribank. It can be used to load either an FPGA firmware or a PIC
firmware. It is normally run by the script xpp_fxloader.

.SH OPTIONS
.B -D 
.I device-path
.RS
Required. The device to read from/write to. On modern UDEV-based system
this is usually /dev/bus/usb/\fIbus_num\fR/\fIdevice_num\fR,
where \fIbus_num\fR and \fIdevice_num\fR are the first two numbers in the
output of lsusb(8).
On older systems that use usbfs, it is usually
/proc/bus/usb/\fIbus_num\fR/\fIdevice_num\fR.
